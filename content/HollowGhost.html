<a href="https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/9avj5p/svbkvlt-kai-luen-hollow-ghost-track">  press and reviews for the record</a>

<p>"The inimitable SVBKVLT is one of the only labels out there that is making grime music as it should be heard; none of this pseudo bass and quasi house, just the real gear aimed at getting your head nodding up and down in the car - shotgun, preferably. Kai Luen is a newcomer to the scene, but we're sure that we'll be hearing him soon and often given how masterful his skills on the mixing desk seem to be with these ten stone-cold killers. "The Hollow Ghost" itself contains all the elements of classic grime joints by the likes of Plastician, while others like "LA 92" or strive down headier paths, sometimes landing on hints of hip-hop or Burial-like percussion excursions. The real shit."  <a href="https://www.junodownload.com/products/kai-luen-the-hollow-ghost/3062911-02/" target="_blank"> *Juno Records review </a>  </p>
